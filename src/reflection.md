Reflection on Using GitHub Copilot for Data Cleaning

What Copilot Generated
GitHub Copilot helped generate several functions in this project. Specifically, the `load_data()` and `clean_column_names()` functions were primarily generated by Copilot. I prompted Copilot by writing descriptive comments above the function definitions, such as “Load the raw sales CSV file into a pandas DataFrame” and “Standardize column names to lowercase and underscores.” Copilot then suggested code to accomplish these tasks, which served as a solid starting point for my implementation.

What You Modified
Although Copilot provided functional code, I made several modifications to ensure the functions met the assignment requirements. For `load_data()`, I added error handling to catch a missing file. For `clean_column_names()`, I ensured the column names were stripped of extra spaces and replaced spaces with underscores consistently. I also created additional functions, such as `strip_text_fields()`, `handle_missing_values()`, and `remove_invalid_rows()`, which Copilot either did not suggest or required adjustments to meet the specific cleaning rules for this dataset. These changes were necessary to ensure data consistency, remove invalid entries, and handle missing values appropriately.

What You Learned
This project reinforced key data cleaning techniques in Python, such as standardizing column names, removing invalid rows, and handling missing values. I learned that small inconsistencies in product names or categories, like extra spaces or different capitalization, can significantly affect data analysis. Copilot was useful in quickly generating boilerplate code and suggested approaches I might not have considered, but it often required careful review and modification to align with the dataset’s specifics and the assignment requirements. For example, Copilot initially suggested filling missing numeric values, but I decided dropping rows with missing prices or quantities was more consistent for this dataset.

Reflection on Using Copilot
Overall, using Copilot made the coding process faster and helped me focus on higher-level decisions, such as the sequence of cleaning steps and handling invalid data. However, it also highlighted that AI-generated code is not always perfect: I had to critically evaluate its suggestions, rename variables for clarity, and adjust logic to handle edge cases. This experience showed me that Copilot is a powerful assistant, but responsible use requires understanding both the code it generates and the underlying data problems to ensure accurate and reliable results.
